## 💼 About Me

I’m a **trusted protector of digital truth** with over **26 years** inside the **South African Police Service (SAPS)**, combining forensic expertise with operational IT leadership.  
From covert cybercrime investigations to **managing over 80,000 devices** across 9 provinces, I believe **technology matters most when people trust the process** behind it.

- 🛡️ **Integrity First**: Known for meticulous chain-of-custody and straight-talk in vendor management & investigations  
- 🖥️ **Tech Hands-On**: From PowerShell audits to Windows 11 deployments and server architecture  
- 👥 **Servant Leader**: Mentor to junior cyber investigators & cross-functional teams  
- 📊 **Data Storyteller**: Build clear Power BI dashboards that reveal insights before incidents happen  
- ☕ **Coffee-fueled** and calm under pressure

> “Evidence loses value when people can’t trust the process – my mission is to keep that trust rock-solid.”
